## Required Homework


### Instrument Honeycomb with OTEL

- Created HoneyComb Account

HoneyComb Account create and linked to GitHub.

- Created new environment

- Each environment has a set of API keys that needs to be used for integration (via `environment variables` with e.g. Gitpod etc. Those API keys will then be used automatically whenever Gitpod is trying to send traces to Honeycomb

- Set Gitpod `environment variables` using the HoneyComb API keys. 

```sh
export HONEYCOMB_API_KEY="REDACTED"
export HONEYCOMB_SERVICE_NAME="Cruddur"

gp env HONEYCOMB_API_KEY="REDACTED"
gp env HONEYCOMB_SERVICE_NAME="Cruddur"
```

- Modify docker-compose file to add `env vars`

- Modify docker-compose file to add OpenTelemetry variables for the backend-flask service

:warning: **Warning:** I had to set the `HONEYCOMB_SERVICE_NAME` variable globally for this task, however it is not recommended for production as this should be set per service!

[Commit link to adding HONEYCOMB_SERVICE_NAME](https://github.com/morpheus04/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/commit/35fc97e5440b4381b011890025c0cea30b42a07d?diff=split#diff-e45e45baeda1c1e73482975a664062aa56f20c03dd9d64a827aba57775bed0d3)

- Install the Python modules for OpenTelemetry

[This was done by adding the dependencies to the `requirements.txt`](https://github.com/morpheus04/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/commit/35fc97e5440b4381b011890025c0cea30b42a07d?diff=split#diff-55d5801c5f315ed423b03e986f4ecf1d3915c097ac8c66c733f0e4cbc17cfee3)

```sh
opentelemetry-api 
opentelemetry-sdk 
opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http 
opentelemetry-instrumentation-flask 
opentelemetry-instrumentation-requests
```

Then install these OpenTelemetry dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Libraries Import Add to app.py

`opentelemetry` modules need to import the required libraries to carry out instructions. This is seen in the [commit link](https://github.com/morpheus04/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/commit/35fc97e5440b4381b011890025c0cea30b42a07d?diff=split#diff-0014cc1f7ffd53e63ff797f0f2925a994fbd6797480d9ca5bbc5dc65f1b56438)

- Initialize automatic instrumentation with Flask

These instruction should be in the main app function `app = Flask(__name__)` as seen in the [commit link](https://github.com/morpheus04/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/commit/35fc97e5440b4381b011890025c0cea30b42a07d?diff=split#diff-0014cc1f7ffd53e63ff797f0f2925a994fbd6797480d9ca5bbc5dc65f1b56438)

- Run Backend app via docker-compose file

Ran the `docker-compose.yml` file just for the backend app

```sh
# HoneyComb ----------
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.flask import FlaskInstrumentor
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.requests import RequestsInstrumentor
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor
```

  - Dataset "Cruddur" was created
  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37842433/222801270-3962d958-5b1f-41fe-ab35-0f48e00f83e0.png)
  

- Added a Span to create traces

Modified `home_activities.py` by adding the code below

``` sh
from opentelemetry import trace
tracer = trace.get_tracer("home.activities")
```

- Create Mock Data Span
  - Modified the class `HomeActivities`
  - inside `def run()` function of `home_activities.py` by adding the code below

```sh
with tracer.start_as_current_span("home-activities-mock-data"): now = datetime.now(timezone.utc).astimezone()
```

- Span Result

### Run queries to explore traces within Honeycomb.io

Ran query to get `AVG, COUNT of http_code=200`
